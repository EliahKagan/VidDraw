# About These Fonts

[Open Sans](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Open+Sans) and [Open Sans
Condensed](https://github.com/google/fonts/tree/09fe88e80988f324709ccf93cf3e29bc3dd90652/apache/opensanscondensed)
were designed by Steve Matteson of Ascender Corporation. As indicated by the
font files&rsquo; embedded metadata, they are &copy; 2011 Google Corporation.
They are released under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (see `LICENSE.txt` in
each directory).

Please note that the font files given here are not the same files that were
downloaded from the Google Fonts pages linked above. Those were `.ttf` files,
while the `.woff` files here were produced by converting them to WOFF format
using
[`sfnt2woff`](https://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/jammy/en/man1/sfnt2woff.1.html).
This is a form of lossless compression; the exact, byte-for-byte original files
can be produced using
[`woff2sfnt`](https://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/jammy/en/man1/woff2sfnt.1.html).
