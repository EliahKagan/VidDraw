    <h1>VidDraw Help - Couldn&rsquo;t redirect</h1>
    <p>
      Vid&shy;Draw Help tried to redirect to the file whose name appears in the
      address bar after <code>?path=</code>. (Under these circumstances, any
      attempt to show the filename in the content of this page would probably
      not work either.) Usually this is due to JavaScript being disabled.
