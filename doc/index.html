<h1>VidDraw - record video as you draw</h1>
<p><em>Written in 2021 by Eliah Kagan &lt;degeneracypressure<!-- -->@gmail.com&gt;</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Vid­Draw</strong> is a Windows program that records a video of a canvas as you draw on it. Recording starts when you begin drawing and stops when you’re no longer holding down any mouse buttons.</p>
<p>The main purpose of Vid­Draw is to demonstrate usage of <a href="https://github.com/baSSiLL/SharpAvi" title="https://github.com/baSSiLL/SharpAvi">Sharp­Avi</a> (which wraps <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/vfw/" title="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/vfw/">VfW</a>) and <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/design/shell/tiles-and-notifications/send-local-toast?tabs=uwp" title="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/design/shell/tiles-and-notifications/send-local-toast?tabs=uwp">toast notifications</a>. It started out as a prototype for the video recording feature of a larger program I’ve been working on. It is also kind of a fun toy.</p>
<p>This is <strong>Vid­Draw alpha 1</strong>. It still has <a href="#known-bugs" title="#known-bugs">some usability bugs</a>.</p>

</section>
<section id="setup" class="level2">
<h2>Setup</h2>
<p>This alpha version of Vid­Draw doesn’t have binary downloads, so it must be built from source. You’ll need the <a href="https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/5.0" title="https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/5.0">.NET 5</a> SDK. To clone the repository and build Vid­Draw, run:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1"><pre class="sourceCode powershell"><code class="sourceCode powershell"><span id="cb1-1"><a href="#cb1-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>git clone https<span class="op">://</span>github<span class="op">.</span><span class="fu">com</span><span class="op">/</span>EliahKagan<span class="op">/</span>VidDraw<span class="op">.</span><span class="fu">git</span></span>
<span id="cb1-2"><a href="#cb1-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="fu">cd</span> VidDraw</span>
<span id="cb1-3"><a href="#cb1-3" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>dotnet build</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Then, to run the program:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb2"><pre class="sourceCode powershell"><code class="sourceCode powershell"><span id="cb2-1"><a href="#cb2-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>dotnet run</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Those commands build and run a “debug” build. If you want a “release” build instead, use <code>dotnet build -c Release</code> and <code>dotnet run -c Release</code>.</p>
<p>Dependencies not included in this repository will be <a href="https://www.nuget.org/" title="https://www.nuget.org/">downloaded automatically</a>. Running <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tools/dotnet-run" title="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tools/dotnet-run"><code>dotnet run</code></a> without first running <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tools/dotnet-build" title="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tools/dotnet-build"><code>dotnet build</code></a> also works, though if you do that the first time, it may appear to have frozen for a short while, as dependencies are downloaded. (In contrast, <code>dotnet build</code> is more verbose.)</p>
<p>If you prefer to open the solution file <code>VidDraw.sln</code> in Visual Studio 2019 and build Vid­Draw from there, that is also supported.</p>
<p>That’s all you need. If you want to read about codec stuff… read on! Otherwise, you may want to skip to <a href="#usage-tips" title="#usage-tips">Usage Tips</a> or <a href="#the-menu" title="#the-menu">The Menu</a>, or just try out the program.</p>
<section id="optional-get-x264vfw-for-h264-support" class="level3">
<h3>Optional: Get x264vfw for H.264 support</h3>
<p>If you want Vid­Draw to be able to encode H.264 video, you’ll need <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/x264vfw/" title="https://sourceforge.net/projects/x264vfw/">x264vfw</a>. You don’t have to install that before Vid­Draw, though. You can even install it while Vid­Draw is already running, and H.264 will be ungrayed in Vid­Draw’s menu.</p>
<p>In the x264vfw configuration, you should check the box for “Zero Latency” <a href="https://github.com/baSSiLL/SharpAvi/wiki/Using-Video-Encoders#creating-video-encoder" title="https://github.com/baSSiLL/SharpAvi/wiki/Using-Video-Encoders#creating-video-encoder">to avoid picture freezes</a> while encoding video in real time. Note that the 32-bit and 64-bit x264vfw codecs are configured separately; changing the configuration for one doesn’t affect the other.</p>
<p>x264fw’s installer creates “Configure x264vfw” and “Configure x264vfw64” shortcuts (or just one, if you told it to install the codec for just one architecture or you’re on a 32-bit system). Besides those shortcuts, another way to open the x264vfw configuration dialog is from the menu in Vid­Draw: so long as x264vfw is installed for the same architecture as the running Vid­Draw process, a “Configure x264vfw (x86)” or “Configure x264vfw (x64)” menu item will appear.</p>
</section>
<section id="a-problem-with-h264-in-viddraw" class="level3">
<h3>A problem with H.264 in VidDraw</h3>
<p>Encoding with H.264 produces much smaller files than Motion JPEG, which is Vid­Draw’s default and itself much smaller than encodings without any compression. But I’ve found that these H.264-encoded files—files recorded in real time in the way Vid­Draw records them, <em>not</em> H.264 video in general—are not playable on all players. <a href="#video-files-are-not-always-playable-on-all-players" title="#video-files-are-not-always-playable-on-all-players">This may be due to a bug in Vid­Draw, but I’m not sure.</a> The excellent and very popular VLC does not play them. Windows Media Player and the Movies &amp; TV app (and also <a href="https://mpc-hc.org/" title="https://mpc-hc.org/">MPC-HC</a>) do play them.</p>
<p>Other than just using Motion JPEG instead (or waiting until Vid­Draw is out of alpha?), there are a couple workarounds to produce a video that VLC will play:</p>
<section id="configure-x264vfw-to-make-every-frame-a-keyframe" class="level4">
<h4>Configure x264vfw to make every frame a keyframe</h4>
<p>At the cost of considerably larger files (but still not as big as Motion JPEG), making every frame a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_frame" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_frame">keyframe</a> fixes the problem in VLC. To do that, open the x264vfw configuration dialog and—in the textarea labeled “Extra command line (for advanced users)”—put:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb3"><pre class="sourceCode sh"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb3-1"><a href="#cb3-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="ex">--keyint</span> 1</span></code></pre></div>

</section>
<section id="post-process-the-video-with-ffmpeg" class="level4">
<h4>Post-process the video with FFmpeg</h4>
<p>Given a video from Vid­Draw that VLC cannot open, <a href="https://ffmpeg.org/" title="https://ffmpeg.org/">FFmpeg</a> will repair it:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb4"><pre class="sourceCode powershell"><code class="sourceCode powershell"><span id="cb4-1"><a href="#cb4-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>ffmpeg <span class="op">-</span>err_detect ignore_err <span class="op">-</span>i <span class="st">&quot;VidDraw capture 2021-05-08 16-38-04.avi&quot;</span> <span class="op">-</span>c <span class="fu">copy</span> <span class="st">&quot;VidDraw capture 2021-05-08 16-38-04 fixed.avi&quot;</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>You would run that from the <code>Videos</code> folder (where Vid­Draw saved the file). Change <code>VidDraw capture 2021-05-08 16-38-04.avi</code> to the actual name of the file Vid­Draw created. The second filename names FFmpeg’s output file; put whatever you like for that.</p>

<section id="optional-regenerate-the-documentation" class="level3">
<h3>Optional: Regenerate the Documentation</h3>
<p>If you’re just building and using Vid­Draw, and not modifying it—or modifying it but not modifying its documentation—you can skip this section.</p>
<p>Vid­Draw comes with <code>doc\index.html</code>. Building Vid­Draw as described above places a copy of that file (and some others) in the build output directory, which the program’s <a href="#about-viddraw" title="#about-viddraw">built-in help viewer</a> displays. <code>doc\index.html</code> is itself generated from <code>README.md</code>, and building Vid­Draw does not regenerate it. If you’re hacking on Vid­Draw and you make changes to <code>README.md</code> or to files in the <code>pandoc</code> directory, then you should regenerate it by running the <code>generate.cmd</code> script in the <code>pandoc</code> directory:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb5"><pre class="sourceCode powershell"><code class="sourceCode powershell"><span id="cb5-1"><a href="#cb5-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>pandoc\generate<span class="op">.</span><span class="fu">cmd</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>(That assumes you are in the repository’s top-level directory.)</p>
<p>If you’re on a Unix-like operating system or otherwise using a Unix-style shell, such as Bash, use the <code>generate</code> shell script instead:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb6"><pre class="sourceCode sh"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb6-1"><a href="#cb6-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="ex">pandoc/generate</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Note that while generating Vid­Draw’s documentation is supported on Unix-like systems, neither building nor running the program is supported on any non-Windows operating systems.</p>
<p>On 64-bit Windows systems, if you don't have <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pandoc" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pandoc">Pandoc</a>, one way to install it is with <a href="https://scoop.sh/" title="https://scoop.sh/">Scoop</a>:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb7"><pre class="sourceCode powershell"><code class="sourceCode powershell"><span id="cb7-1"><a href="#cb7-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>scoop install pandoc</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Modifications to files other than <code>README.md</code> and those in the <code>pandoc</code> directory do not require <code>doc\index.html</code> to be regenerated.</p>

<section id="usage-tips" class="level2">
<h2>Usage Tips</h2>
<p>Vid­Draw’s interface is clean and simple… yet remarkably confusing to use. Sorry. Maybe some of the following information will help.</p>
<section id="drawing-and-recording" class="level3">
<h3>Drawing and Recording</h3>
<p><strong>Draw</strong> as you would in any raster graphics editor.</p>
<p>When the mouse cursor is over the canvas and you press the primary mouse button, recording begins. Moving the mouse while the primary mouse button is pressed draws on the canvas. Recording continues until you release the button.</p>
<p>Even pressing the primary mouse button for a very short time records a video. A single short click is sufficient, though the video may consist of only one frame.</p>
<p>You will know Vid­Draw is recording because the border around the canvas turns bright red. As long as it is red, Vid­Draw is recording. When it turns back to light gray, recording has stopped and the video file is fully saved.</p>
<p><strong>To lift the pen while continuing to record</strong>, press and hold another mouse button. So long as at least one button is pressed, recording continues. This lets you make an video of drawing a sketch with multiple disconnected strokes.</p>
<p>If you ever want to continue recording while no mouse buttons are pressed, place the mouse cursor on the canvas, press and hold any mouse button, drag the cursor out of the canvas, press any other mouse button, then release both buttons (in either order). This effect, of keeping recording on even though you’re not holding down any mouse button, persists until your next interaction with the canvas. So, to stop recording, click the canvas. (If you don’t want to draw anything, click it with some button other than the primary mouse button.) Or you can resume drawing, and the next time you release all mouse buttons, recording will stop.</p>
<p>When recording has stopped and the border has turned back from red to gray, the file is fully saved and should be playable, whether Vid­Draw is still running or not. Conversely, it is fine to quit while still recording. Vid­Draw stops recording and cleanly saves the file on exit.</p>
<p>The pen color can be changed using <a href="#pick-color" title="#pick-color">the color picker</a>, available in <a href="#the-menu" title="#the-menu">the menu</a>.</p>
<p>The canvas in Vid­Draw is always 800×600.</p>
</section>
<section id="save-location-and-toast-notifications" class="level3">
<h3>Save Location and Toast Notifications</h3>
<p>Vid­Draw saves files in your Videos folder. The location of this folder is configurable per-user in Windows, but by default it is the folder called <code>Videos</code> and located directly in your home folder.</p>
<p>When a recording ends (while Vid­Draw is still running), Vid­Draw raises a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pop-up_notification" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pop-up_notification">toast notification</a> informing you of the filename as well as the encoding that was used for the video. Clicking this notification opens a file browser (i.e., Explorer) window for the destination folder, with the newly finished video selected.</p>
<p>Vid­Draw names files by the date and time at which it <em>started</em> recording them. The filenames consist of <code>VidDraw capture</code> followed by the date and time, like <code>VidDraw capture 2021-05-09 21-49-12</code>. (The ugly hyphen-delimited time is because Windows filesystems like NTFS don’t support colon characters in filenames.) This file exists immediately once recording has started, though it may not be playable—and is not guaranteed to be openable by other applications—until recording is completed.</p>
<p>Since clicking the notification opens the destination folder and selects the file, you can rename it easily to whatever name you actually want it to have.</p>
<p>Quitting Vid­Draw clears any notifications that have not been clicked or dismissed. <em>Unless</em> you were running multiple instances of Vid­Draw—in that case, they all stick around until the last instance is closed. <em>Unless</em> some instances are running in 64-bit mode while others are running in 32-bit mode—in that case, quitting the last 64-bit instance clears any remaining notifications from 64-bit instances, while quitting the last 32-bit instance clears any remaining notifications from 32-bit instances.</p>
<p>Vid­Draw is only able to raise toast notifications on Windows 10, version 10.0.17763 or later. If Vid­Draw can’t raise toast notifications on your system, it falls back to opening the Explorer window immediately when recording finishes. But if Vid­Draw can’t show you a notification because you’ve configured notifications in Windows 10 not to show them (or turned them off), then Vid­Draw does <em>not</em> try to circumvent this by showing a file browser window. In that case, nothing special happens when recording finishes.</p>
<p>You can always open the destination folder by clicking “Open Videos Folder” <a href="#the-menu" title="#the-menu">in Vid­Draw’s menu</a>.</p>
</section>
</section>
<section id="the-menu" class="level2">
<h2>The Menu</h2>
<p>Vid­Draw augments its <em>system menu</em>—the application menu that you can open by left- or right-clicking on the left side of the title bar, right-clicking anywhere on the title bar, or pressing <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Space</kbd>, and that contains standard items like “Move” and “Close”—with <a href="#encoding-codec-choices" title="#encoding-codec-choices">encoding choices</a> and some <a href="#other-stuff-in-the-menu" title="#other-stuff-in-the-menu">other operations</a> specific to Vid­Draw.</p>
<p>Some menu items change settings. These changes are saved in a <code>VidDraw</code> subdirectory of your per-user application data (<code>%APPDATA%</code>) directory, which is usually <code>%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Roaming</code> (where <code>%USERPROFILE%</code> is your home directory).</p>
<section id="encoding-codec-choices" class="level3">
<h3>Encoding (“Codec”) Choices</h3>
<p>There are currently four video encodings available. The selected encoding has a check mark to the left of it in the menu. Exactly one is selected at any given time.</p>
<p>Please note that this doesn’t affect the file format, i.e., container filetype, which is always AVI. Rather, it affects the encoding of the video stream.</p>
<p>Your codec choice is remembered across runs of the program.</p>
<section id="raw-frame-copy" class="level4">
<h4>Raw (frame copy)</h4>
<p>This is the worst possible encoding and I don’t recommend using it. Each bitmap is captured from the canvas as-is, including the alpha channel data (the “A” in “ARGB”). The canvas, and the recorded video stream, use different conventions for the order in which each line (row of pixels) is stored, so this order is reversed; otherwise, it is a raw “frame copy.”</p>
<p>The only reason I put this in Vid­Draw was to demonstrate how to write video frames in Sharp­Avi without an <a href="https://github.com/baSSiLL/SharpAvi/wiki/Using-Video-Encoders" title="https://github.com/baSSiLL/SharpAvi/wiki/Using-Video-Encoders">encoder</a>. But you should use an encoder. If you want uncompressed video, I recommend using <a href="#uncompressed" title="#uncompressed">Uncompressed</a> instead, which leaves out the unused alpha channel.</p>
</section>
<section id="uncompressed" class="level4">
<h4>Uncompressed</h4>
<p>If you want uncompressed video (where each frame is a bitmap), you should use this. It uses Sharp­Avi’s <code>UncompressedVideoEncoder</code>. As the <a href="https://github.com/baSSiLL/SharpAvi/wiki/Using-Video-Encoders#creating-video-encoder" title="https://github.com/baSSiLL/SharpAvi/wiki/Using-Video-Encoders#creating-video-encoder">Sharp­Avi wiki</a> says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The simplest [encoder] is <a href="https://github.com/baSSiLL/SharpAvi/blob/master/SharpAvi/Codecs/UncompressedVideoEncoder.cs" title="https://github.com/baSSiLL/SharpAvi/blob/master/SharpAvi/Codecs/UncompressedVideoEncoder.cs">UncompressedVideoEncoder</a>. It does no real encoding, just flips image vertically and converts BGR32 data to BGR24 data to reduce the size.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Video files created this way are quite large, if you’re recording for more a few seconds. If you’re keeping videos you create this way, you may want to encode them with a compressed codec afterwards. If your hard disk is slow, you may experience lag while encoding this way. It’s still better than <a href="#raw-frame-copy" title="#raw-frame-copy">Raw (frame copy)</a>, though.</p>
</section>
<section id="motion-jpeg" class="level4">
<h4>Motion JPEG</h4>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_JPEG" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_JPEG">Motion JPEG</a> is Vid­Draw’s default encoding. Each frame is converted to and stored as a JPEG image. This uses Sharp­Avi’s <code>MotionJpegVideoEncoderWpf</code>. From the <a href="https://github.com/baSSiLL/SharpAvi/wiki/Using-Video-Encoders#creating-video-encoder" title="https://github.com/baSSiLL/SharpAvi/wiki/Using-Video-Encoders#creating-video-encoder">Sharp­Avi wiki</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Next is <a href="https://github.com/baSSiLL/SharpAvi/blob/master/SharpAvi/Codecs/MotionJpegVideoEncoderWpf.cs" title="https://github.com/baSSiLL/SharpAvi/blob/master/SharpAvi/Codecs/MotionJpegVideoEncoderWpf.cs">MotionJpegVideoEncoderWpf</a> which does Motion JPEG encoding. It uses <code>System.Windows.Media.Imaging.JpegBitmapEncoder</code> under the hood. Besides dimensions, you provide the desired quality level to its constructor, ranging from 1 (low quality, small size) to 100 (high quality, large size).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Vid­Draw uses a quality of 100, since the pen in Vid­Draw makes 1-pixel-thick curves, and lower qualities of Motion JPEG (like the oft-used 70) tend not to render such curves crisply.</p>
<p>The file size is unhappily large, but nowhere near as bad as the uncompressed encodings.</p>
</section>
<section id="h264-mpeg-4-avc" class="level4">
<h4>H.264 (MPEG-4 AVC)</h4>
<p>If the <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/x264vfw/" title="https://sourceforge.net/projects/x264vfw/">x264vfw</a> codec (of the same architecture as the Vid­Draw process) <a href="#optional-get-x264vfw-for-h264-support" title="#optional-get-x264vfw-for-h264-support">is installed</a>, the menu item for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Video_Coding" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Video_Coding">H.264</a> is unfaded. It isn’t the default because Vid­Draw doesn’t ship that codec and you may not already have it, and because there are <a href="#a-problem-with-h264-in-viddraw" title="#a-problem-with-h264-in-viddraw">configuration choices for you to make</a> and <a href="#video-files-are-not-always-playable-on-all-players" title="#video-files-are-not-always-playable-on-all-players">playback issues to wrangle with</a>.</p>
<p>Still, I recommend encoding in H.264 if you can, because it produces higher quality than <a href="#motion-jpeg" title="#motion-jpeg">Motion JPEG</a> at a small fraction of the file size (<em>even</em> if you use <a href="#configure-x264vfw-to-make-every-frame-a-keyframe" title="#configure-x264vfw-to-make-every-frame-a-keyframe"><code>--keyint 1</code></a>).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Finally, <a href="https://github.com/baSSiLL/SharpAvi/blob/master/SharpAvi/Codecs/Mpeg4VideoEncoderVcm.cs" title="https://github.com/baSSiLL/SharpAvi/blob/master/SharpAvi/Codecs/Mpeg4VideoEncoderVcm.cs">Mpeg4VideoEncoderVcm</a> does MPEG-4 encoding using <em>Video for Windows</em> (aka <em>VfW</em>) or <em>Video Compression Manager</em> (aka <em>VCM</em>) compatible codec installed on the system.</p>

<h3>Other Stuff in the Menu</h3>
<section id="clear-canvas" class="level4">
<h4>Clear Canvas</h4>
<p>If the canvas has not been drawn on since opening Sharp­Avi, or since the last time it was cleared, then the “Clear Canvas” option is unfaded. This clears the canvas, making all pixels white, as they started.</p>
</section>
<section id="pick-color" class="level4">
<h4>Pick Color…</h4>
<p>The pen color is black by default. “Pick Color…” opens a color picker in which you can choose another color. The color picker is based on <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.windows.forms.colordialog?view=net-5.0" title="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.windows.forms.colordialog?view=net-5.0"><code>ColorDialog</code></a>, which wraps the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/dlgbox/color-dialog-box" title="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/dlgbox/color-dialog-box">standard Windows color dialog box</a> and, as such, allows you to define custom color presets. Vid­Draw saves your custom colors, so they are available if you quit Vid­Draw and run it again. Your custom Vid­Draw colors do not appear in any other programs’ color dialogs.</p>
<p>(Unfortunately, defining custom colors but cancelling out of the color picker discards the new custom colors—you have to click “OK.” Since this is what users familiar with the Windows color dialog expect, I don’t think I should try to change it for Vid­Draw’s color picker.)</p>
</section>
<section id="open-videos-folder" class="level4">
<h4>Open Videos Folder</h4>
<p>Clicking “Open Videos Folder” opens the destination folder where Vid­Draw saves videos. This is your per-user <code>Videos</code> (or <code>My Videos</code>) directory.</p>
<p>This is handy if you meant to click to activate a toast notification after recording, but dismissed it instead.</p>
<p>In the strange case that you record a video and, while Vid­Draw is still running, change the location of your per-user <code>Videos</code> folder, this goes to the new place, not the old one. (The new location is the destination for any further videos Vid­Draw saves, even during the same run of the program.)</p>

<h4>Download x264vfw<br> <em>or</em> Configure x264vfw (x64)<br> <em>or</em> Configure x264vfw (x86)</h4>
<p>If x264vfw is not installed, or it is installed but not for the same architecture as the Vid­Draw process, then Vid­Draw cannot use it. In this case, the menu contains a “Download x264vfw” item that opens the x264vfw download page in your web browser.</p>
<p>If x264vfw is installed for the architecture of the Vid­Draw process, then Vid­Draw can use it, and the menu contains either a “Configure x264vfw (x64)” or “Configure x264vfw (x86)” item, depending on the architecture of the Vid­Draw process (i.e., whether it’s running as a 64-bit process or a 32-bit process, respectively).</p>
<p>Clicking “Configure x264vfw” opens x264vfw’s own configuration dialog. This dialog is not part of Vid­Draw, and configuration changes you make in it affect x264vfw on your whole system; they are not specific to Vid­Draw. But they <em>are</em> specific to the 64-bit (x64) or 32-bit (x86) version of x264vfw. By default, all remotely recent versions of x264vfw install both the 64-bit and 32-bit codecs. They must be configured separately.</p>

<h2>Known Bugs</h2>
<section id="an-indirect-dependency-has-confusing-licensing" class="level3">
<h3>An indirect dependency has confusing licensing.</h3>
<p>Vid­Draw has <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/win32metadata" title="https://github.com/microsoft/win32metadata">win32metadata</a> as an indirect dependency, via <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/CsWin32" title="https://github.com/microsoft/CsWin32">CsWin32</a>. win32metadata’s <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/win32metadata" title="https://github.com/microsoft/win32metadata">GitHub repository</a> is <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/win32metadata/blob/master/LICENSE" title="https://github.com/microsoft/win32metadata/blob/master/LICENSE">MIT licensed</a>, but its <a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Windows.SDK.Win32Metadata" title="https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Windows.SDK.Win32Metadata">NuGet package</a> shows the <a href="https://aka.ms/WinSDKLicenseURL" title="https://aka.ms/WinSDKLicenseURL">Windows SDK license</a>. This <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/win32metadata/issues/387" title="https://github.com/microsoft/win32metadata/issues/387">is intentional</a>.</p>
<p>I’m unclear on what, if any, actual restrictions this imposes on how the source code, or a compiled binary, of Vid­Draw, can be used. I intend that Vid­Draw be both permissively licensed and GPL-compatible. Adding the CsWin32 package prompted for win32metadata license acceptance. Even if this doesn’t conflict with those goals, I fear it may chill reuse and adaptation of Vid­Draw, unless clarified. So this should either be clarified, or the CsWin32 dependency removed (which would actually not be too hard). This should be done before the release of alpha 2 and preferably before the release of alpha 1.</p>

<section id="sometimes-there-is-an-initial-lag-on-the-first-recording" class="level3">
<h3>Sometimes there is an initial lag on the first recording.</h3>
<p>This seems to happen mainly while debugging—even a debug build that is being run (via <code>dotnet run</code> or by directly running the compiled executable) is most often free of it. But it seems to happen occasionally even outside of debugging.</p>
<p>This is annoying because, when it happens, it usually results in a straight line segment appearing on the canvas (and in the video) that the user didn’t intend to draw.</p>
<p>Vid­Draw could do some operations asynchronously that it now does on the UI thread. Most or all file I/O could, and should, be asynchronous. Implementing this will require thought about what to do in some race conditions that cannot currently happen.</p>
<p>I don’t know if that would be sufficient to fix this bug.</p>
</section>
<section id="video-files-are-not-always-playable-on-all-players" class="level3">
<h3>Video files are not always playable on all players.</h3>
<p><a href="#a-problem-with-h264-in-viddraw" title="#a-problem-with-h264-in-viddraw">As detailed above</a>, when H.264 encoding is selected and x264vfw has not been configured to make every frame a keyframe (which increases file size dramatically, albeit still less than the other encodings), VLC cannot play the file. This is even though VLC fully supports H.264 (and manages to play even most broken H.264 videos). It may be a problem with the way I’ve configured x264vfw. But <a href="https://ffmpeg.org/" title="https://ffmpeg.org/">FFmpeg</a> is able to repair the files, and it reports problems with them, so I think this is a bug.</p>
<p>I can produce this problem (on the same system) with the Sharp­Avi sample application—both the <a href="https://github.com/baSSiLL/SharpAvi/tree/master/Sample" title="https://github.com/baSSiLL/SharpAvi/tree/master/Sample">upstream version</a> targeting the <a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/SharpAvi/" title="https://www.nuget.org/packages/SharpAvi/">upstream Sharp­Avi</a> and <a href="https://github.com/EliahKagan/SharpAvi/tree/net5/Sample" title="https://github.com/EliahKagan/SharpAvi/tree/net5/Sample">my forked version</a> targeting <a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/SharpAvi.Net5" title="https://www.nuget.org/packages/SharpAvi.Net5">the fork of Sharp­Avi</a> that Vid­Draw uses. But it remains unclear to me, due to its sensitivity to x264vfw settings, whether it is due to a bug in Sharp­Avi. I can also produce it in the Sharp­Avi sample application with <a href="https://www.xvid.com/" title="https://www.xvid.com/">Xvid</a> (but, likewise, this might turn out to be because of how I have Xvid configured).</p>

<section id="the-helps-sidenav-is-brittle" class="level3">
<h3>The help’s sidenav is brittle.</h3>
<section id="it-can-be-partially-present-without-user-intent" class="level4">
<h4>It can be “partially present” without user intent.</h4>
<p>Narrowing the viewport fades the navigational sidebar out; widening fades it in. Whether or not it is faded, and how faded, is determined solely by (scaled) viewport width. This works okay when the user resizes the window. But it is possible for the viewport to <em>start</em> with a “transitional” width at which the sidebar is present but faded. In that case, the user is likely to think either that the sidebar is meant to look this way (i.e., poorly designed) or that a bug causes it to appear this way (either always, or under limited but unclear circumstances).</p>
<p>This isn’t likely to happen in Vid­Draw’s own help viewer, but general-purpose web browsers don’t start out with a predetermined (scaled) size selected to make this specific page look reasonable. The help file—and its sidenav—is meant to be fully usable on web browsers, too.</p>
</section>
<section id="rarely-it-overlaps-the-main-text" class="level4">
<h4>Rarely, it overlaps the main text.</h4>
<p>On an iPad I tested with, when oriented in profile, the sidenav neither fades nor disappears when there is insufficient space, causing it to overlap the main text. This doesn’t seem to happen in landscape or profile at any viewport width on a variety of browsers and operating systems in a variety of screen resolutions and display scalings.</p>
<p>As above, I don't expect this to affect the program’s help viewer or most other browsing scenarios, but it should still be investigated and fixed. It suggests a design mistake on my part that, if left in place, may manifest in more situations after some seemingly unrelated future change.</p>

<section id="menu-items-are-cumbersome-to-access-while-drawing" class="level3">
<h3>Menu items are cumbersome to access while drawing.</h3>
<p>Some operations that users are likely to want to do while recording—especially opening the dialog box to change the pen color—should have shortcut keys but do not. Some design choices have to be made to implement this correctly: if the user presses a shortcut key to open a modal dialog box, should recording automatically continue after the dialog box exits?</p>
</section>
<section id="it-might-be-useful-to-be-able-to-pause" class="level3">
<h3>It might be useful to be able to pause.</h3>
<p>Vid­Draw’s user experience is intended to be simple and spontaneous, so I haven’t included any option to pause and unpause recording. If recording <em>ever</em> pauses, then users are likely to assume, and some may prefer, that opening a modal dialog box or changing focus to another application will pause it. So, if pausing is added, options to enable (and disable) automatic pausing in those situations should be added too.</p>
<p>Fixing this may help with <a href="#menu-items-are-cumbersome-to-access-while-drawing" title="#menu-items-are-cumbersome-to-access-while-drawing">Menu items are cumbersome to access while drawing</a> as well.</p>

<section id="the-pen-thickness-should-be-adjustable-in-some-way" class="level3">
<h3>The pen thickness should be adjustable in some way.</h3>
<p>Being able to vary the pen’s size would make drawing more fun.</p>
<p>This could be done by holding down modifier keys (<kbd>Shift</kbd>, <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>, <kbd>Alt</kbd>) and/or by selecting something in the menu.</p>

<h3>User experience on older Windows could be better.</h3>
<section id="awkward-toast-fallback" class="level4">
<h4>Awkward toast fallback</h4>
<p>Although it is not a goal for Vid­Draw to fully support any versions of Windows older than 10.0.17763, it might be good to come up with some other behavior than immediately opening the destination folder each time on systems that don’t support toast notifications.</p>
</section>
<section id="thin-title-bars" class="level4">
<h4>Thin title bars</h4>
<p>Old Windows operating systems, such as Windows 7, have very thin title bars, at least when styling is turned off or classic styling is used. This makes the border around the canvas (which turns red to indicate recording) look excessively thick. It’s probably not worth it to detect and handle this situation, but perhaps there’s some simple way.</p>

<h3>VidDraw and x264vfw</h3>
<p>Vid­Draw does not depend on <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/x264vfw/" title="https://sourceforge.net/projects/x264vfw/">x264vfw</a> but is capable of using it <a href="#optional-get-x264vfw-for-h264-support" title="#optional-get-x264vfw-for-h264-support">if it is installed</a>. x264vfw is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_for_Windows" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_for_Windows">VfW</a> codec for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_coding_format" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_coding_format">H.264</a> by Anton Mitrofanov and other authors, derived from <a href="https://www.videolan.org/developers/x264.html" title="https://www.videolan.org/developers/x264.html">x264</a>. Since, when installed and selected in Vid­Draw, it greatly reduces file size while preserving quality, I’m thankful to all the developers of x264vfw and x264 for the work they’ve done. Per its <a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/x264vfw/code/HEAD/tree/trunk/COPYING" title="https://sourceforge.net/p/x264vfw/code/HEAD/tree/trunk/COPYING">COPYING</a> file and license headers in most of <a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/x264vfw/code/HEAD/tree/trunk/" title="https://sourceforge.net/p/x264vfw/code/HEAD/tree/trunk/">its source code files</a>, x264vfw is licensed under <a href="https://spdx.org/licenses/GPL-2.0-or-later.html" title="https://spdx.org/licenses/GPL-2.0-or-later.html">the GNU GPL v2 or later</a>.</p>
<p>Vid­Draw uses x264vfw via Sharp­Avi in a manner analogous to how any VfW codec may be used, doesn’t itself include the codec, and interacts with it <a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.en.html#MereAggregation" title="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.en.html#MereAggregation">at arm’s length</a> (VfW codecs are shared libraries, but as I understand it, programs that use them don’t link to them or directly call API functions that they define). So I believe the GPL does not require that Vid­Draw or any of the libraries Vid­Draw uses be offered under the GPL or have a GPL-compatible license.</p>
<p>Please note that, for practical and ideological reasons unrelated to x264vfw, I still intend Vid­Draw to be GPL-compatible! If it is not, or even if it <a href="#an-indirect-dependency-has-confusing-licensing" title="#an-indirect-dependency-has-confusing-licensing">appears not to be</a>, I’d consider that a serious bug.</p>

   &quot;You&quot; (or &quot;Your&quot;) shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
   exercising permissions granted by this License.

   &quot;Source&quot; form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
   including but not limited to software source code, documentation
   source, and configuration files.

   &quot;Object&quot; form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
   transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
   not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
   and conversions to other media types.

   &quot;Work&quot; shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
   Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
   copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
   (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

   &quot;Derivative Works&quot; shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
   form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
   editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
   represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
   of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
   separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
   the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

   &quot;Contribution&quot; shall mean any work of authorship, including
   the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
   to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally

   or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
   the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, &quot;submitted&quot;
   means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
   to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
   communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
   and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the

   &quot;Contributor&quot; shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
   on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
   subsequently incorporated within the Work.

2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
   this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
   worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
   copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
   publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
   Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
   this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
   worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
   (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
   use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
   where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
   by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
   Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
   with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
   institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
   cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
   or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
   or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
   granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
   as of the date such litigation is filed.

4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
   Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
   modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
   meet the following conditions:

   (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
       Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

   (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
       stating that You changed the files; and

   (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
       that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
       attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
       excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
       the Derivative Works; and

   (d) If the Work includes a &quot;NOTICE&quot; text file as part of its
       distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
       include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
       within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
       pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
       of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
       as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
       documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
       within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
       wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
       of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
       do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
       notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
       or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
       that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
       as modifying the License.

   You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
   may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
   for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
   for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
   reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
   the conditions stated in this License.

5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
   any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
   by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
   this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
   Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
   the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
   with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
   names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
   except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
   origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
   agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
   Contributor provides its Contributions) on an &quot;AS IS&quot; BASIS,
   WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
   implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
   of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
   PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
   appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
   risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
   whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
   unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
   negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
   liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
   incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
   result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
   Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
   work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
   other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
   has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
   the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
   and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
   or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
   License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
   on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
   of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
   defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
   incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
   of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
