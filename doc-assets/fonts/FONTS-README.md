# About These Fonts

[Open Sans](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Open+Sans) and [Open Sans
Condensed](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Open+Sans+Condensed) were designed
by Steve Matteson of Ascender Corporation. As indicated by the font files&rsquo;
embedded metadata, they are &copy; 2011 Google Corporation. They are released under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (see `LICENSE.txt` in each directory).

Please note that the font files given here are not the same files that were
downloaded from the Google Fonts pages linked above. Those were `.ttf` files,
while the `.woff` files here were produced by converting them to WOFF format
using
[`sfnt2woff`](http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/hirsute/en/man1/sfnt2woff.1.html).
This is a form of lossless compression; the exact, byte-for-byte original files
can be produced using
[`woff2sfnt`](http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/hirsute/en/man1/woff2sfnt.1.html).
